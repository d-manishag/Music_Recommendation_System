# Music_Recommendation_System
Created a dynamic music recommendation service utilizing the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Engineered a robust system that tailors song suggestions by analyzing user-provided liked tracks. Employed advanced techniques, including content-based analysis and collaborative filtering, to understand user preferences and offer highly personalized song recommendations. Enhanced the user experience by providing a seamless platform for discovering new music based on individual tastes.

Content-based methods gives recommendations based on the similarity of two song contents or attributes while collaborative methods make a prediction on posible preferences using a matrix with ratings on different songs.


## Content Based Filtering
Highlighted the advantages of content-based methods, emphasizing their computational efficiency and interpretability. Demonstrated their adaptability to novel items and users, underscoring their practicality. Acknowledged a key drawback of content-based systems: the tendency to suggest items similar to the user's existing preferences, potentially limiting the element of serendipity in recommendations. Addressed the need for a balanced approach that accounts for both familiar and novel items to offer a more enriching user experience.

## Collaborative Filtering
Outlined the foundation of collaborative-based methods, highlighting their reliance on an interaction matrix, often referred to as a rating matrix. Emphasized the primary objective of these algorithms: to develop predictive functions that determine user engagement with items, indicating potential interactions such as purchases, listens, or views.

Distinguished two main categories within collaborative-based systems: user-item filtering and item-item filtering. This distinction underscores the strategies used to make recommendationsâ€”either by matching users to items or by leveraging similarities between items. This nuanced understanding of collaborative-based approaches provides a solid foundation for designing effective recommendation systems
